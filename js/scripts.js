Launching Netflix in 1997 as a DVD-by-mail movie-rental service with Marc Randolph, Mr. Hastings grasped early that the internet was the future of distribution. First with old movies and TV shows that Hollywood studios and networks were more than happy to sell, then with original programming such as ‚ÄúHouse of Cards‚Äù and ‚ÄúStranger Things,‚Äù the streaming giant has built a global subscriber base approaching 200 million households world-wide. Along the way, Mr. Hastings has built a distinctive‚Äîand, to some, cutthroat‚Äîcorporate culture. The Netflix way encourages staff to take big risks, typically without the need of approval from a chain of bosses, and to communicate with blunt candor. Leaders often practice what is called the ‚Äúkeeper test,‚Äù in which they ask themselves: If a staffer were offered a job elsewhere, would you fight to keep that employee? If the answer is no, the person is let go. In his new book ‚ÄúNo Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention,‚Äù Mr. Hastings likens being employed at the streaming giant to being part of a sports team: Getting cut is disappointing but carries no shame. ‚ÄúUnlike many companies, we practice: Adequate performance gets a generous severance package,‚Äù reads one of Netflix‚Äôs mottos." ,

Accordingly, there is intense interest in targeting these microbes to promote overall health and to abrogate disease, with considerable advances made recently. Strategies to modulate gut microbes include fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), which involves the transfer of fecal material from one individual to another for a desired physiologic effect.
